## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Test concurrent editing with two users
- [ ] Test field locking mechanism
- [ ] Test debounced saves (observe network tab)
- [ ] Test connection loss and reconnection
- [ ] Test page refresh (locks released?)
- [ ] Test rapid typing (only one server call?)
- [ ] Test dropdown immediate save
- [ ] Test lock expiry (wait 30+ seconds)
- [ ] Test heartbeat (wait 30+ seconds, still connected?)
- [ ] Test visibility change (tab switching)

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Test with slow network (throttle in DevTools)
- [ ] Test with multiple rapid disconnects
- [ ] Test with many concurrent users (10+)
- [ ] Test lock acquisition failure
- [ ] Test server restart during editing
- [ ] Test with very long field values

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Verify all files compiled without errors
- [ ] Check browser console for TypeScript errors
- [ ] Test SSE endpoint manually: `/api/sse/warranty-updates?branchId=1`
- [ ] Review server logs for errors
- [ ] Verify Clerk authentication working
- [ ] Test database connection

### Deployment Configuration

- [ ] Ensure hosting supports SSE (long-lived connections)
- [ ] Set high timeout for SSE connections (5+ minutes)
- [ ] Configure load balancer for sticky sessions (if using)
- [ ] Verify firewall allows SSE
- [ ] Check reverse proxy configuration (nginx/apache)

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Monitor server logs for SSE connections
- [ ] Check connection count (should grow as users connect)
- [ ] Verify lock cleanup is running
- [ ] Test from production URL
- [ ] Verify heartbeats are working
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Monitor database query count

## üìä Monitoring Checklist

### Server Metrics

- [ ] SSE connection count
- [ ] Active lock count
- [ ] Memory usage
- [ ] CPU usage
- [ ] Database query count
- [ ] Average response time

### Client Metrics

- [ ] Connection success rate
- [ ] Reconnection frequency
- [ ] Average lock acquisition time
- [ ] Failed lock attempts
- [ ] Sync frequency
- [ ] Update latency

### Logging

- [ ] SSE connection established logs
- [ ] SSE connection removed logs
- [ ] Lock acquired logs
- [ ] Lock released logs
- [ ] Lock cleanup logs
- [ ] Broadcast logs
- [ ] Error logs

## üîß Configuration Options

### Timing Adjustments (if needed)

- [ ] Lock expiry: Currently 30 seconds (`lib/utils/sse-manager.ts`)
- [ ] Debounce delay: Currently 1 second (`warranty-case-table-wrapper.tsx`)
- [ ] Sync interval: Currently 60 seconds (`warranty-case-table-wrapper.tsx`)
- [ ] Heartbeat: Currently 30 seconds (`lib/utils/sse-manager.ts`)
- [ ] Lock cleanup: Currently 10 seconds (`lib/utils/sse-manager.ts`)
- [ ] Reconnect max attempts: Currently 10 (`use-realtime-updates.ts`)

### Feature Flags (optional)

- [ ] Add ability to disable real-time for specific users
- [ ] Add ability to disable locking for specific fields
- [ ] Add admin dashboard to view connections
- [ ] Add debug mode for verbose logging

## üéØ Optional Enhancements (Phase 2)

### User Experience

- [ ] Conflict resolution dialog
- [ ] Edit history tracking
- [ ] Presence indicators (who's viewing)
- [ ] User avatars in lock tooltips
- [ ] "User is typing..." indicator
- [ ] Real-time notifications

### Technical

- [ ] Redis for distributed lock management
- [ ] Operational Transform (OT) for text fields
- [ ] Offline mode with queue
- [ ] Collaborative undo/redo
- [ ] Field-level timestamps
- [ ] Audit log

### Performance

- [ ] Compression for SSE messages
- [ ] Batch updates before broadcasting
- [ ] Rate limiting per user
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Database connection optimization

## üìù Notes

### Known Limitations

1. SSE requires HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 (works on all modern browsers)
2. Maximum 6 concurrent SSE connections per domain per browser (HTTP/1.1)
3. Locks are in-memory (reset on server restart)
4. No cross-tab synchronization (each tab has own connection)

### Browser Support

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Chromium): Full support
- ‚úÖ Firefox: Full support
- ‚úÖ Safari: Full support
- ‚úÖ Mobile browsers: Full support
- ‚ùå IE11: Not supported (SSE not available)

### Hosting Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Vercel: Full support
- ‚úÖ Netlify: Full support
- ‚úÖ AWS: Full support (configure ALB timeout)
- ‚úÖ Heroku: Full support
- ‚úÖ Self-hosted: Full support

## üéâ Success Criteria

System is working correctly when:

1. ‚úÖ Two users can edit different fields simultaneously
2. ‚úÖ Lock prevents concurrent edits on same field
3. ‚úÖ Changes appear in real-time across all users
4. ‚úÖ Only one database query per second max (check network tab)
5. ‚úÖ Connection indicator shows green when connected
6. ‚úÖ System recovers automatically from disconnect
7. ‚úÖ Page refresh releases locks properly
8. ‚úÖ No data loss in any scenario
9. ‚úÖ User input is never disrupted by updates
10. ‚úÖ System performs well under load
