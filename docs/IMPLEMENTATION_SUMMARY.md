## 🔒 Type Safety

All components are fully typed:

- Server actions return typed promises
- Zustand store is strongly typed
- All props are typed interfaces
- Prisma provides runtime type safety

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests

- Test editable cell editing logic
- Test dropdown selection logic
- Test Zustand store actions
- Test data transformations

### Integration Tests

- Test server actions with mock database
- Test optimistic updates and rollback
- Test error handling

### E2E Tests

- Test complete editing workflow
- Test multi-user scenarios (with socket.io)
- Test edge cases (network failures, etc.)

## 🎓 Architecture Decisions

### Why Zustand?

- Lightweight (minimal bundle size)
- Simple API (no boilerplate)
- React 19 compatible
- Perfect for client-side UI state

### Why Server Actions?

- Type-safe RPC
- Automatic serialization
- Progressive enhancement
- Simplified data mutations

### Why Shadcn?

- Accessible by default (ARIA compliant)
- Customizable (not a black box)
- Composable components
- Great DX with TypeScript

### Why Client Components Only Where Needed?

- Better performance (less JS shipped)
- Better SEO (server-rendered)
- Simpler mental model
- Following Next.js best practices

## 📝 Notes

- All database queries are in server actions (not exposed to client)
- Optimistic updates provide instant feedback
- Error boundaries catch and handle runtime errors
- Loading states improve perceived performance
- Clean separation allows easy unit testing
- Ready for horizontal scaling

## 🎉 Result

A production-ready, scalable, type-safe warranty case management system with excellent UX and clean architecture!
