# Email Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

Added email functionality to send warranty case details with PDF attachment to customer email addresses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies

- Installed `nodemailer` and `@types/nodemailer` packages

### 2. Server Action (`app/branch/[id]/actions.ts`)

- Added `sendWarrantyCaseEmail()` function that:
  - Validates customer email exists
  - Configures nodemailer with custom SMTP settings from environment variables
  - Generates PDF buffer from warranty case data
  - Sends formatted HTML email with PDF attachment
  - Includes comprehensive error handling

### 3. Email Button Component (`components/custom/warranty/send-email-button.tsx`)

- Client component that:
  - Reuses PDF generation logic from `PrintPDFButton`
  - Converts PDF blob to buffer for email attachment
  - Calls server action to send email
  - Shows loading state while sending
  - Displays success/error toast notifications
  - **Only renders if customer email is available**

### 4. Integration (`components/custom/warranty/expandable-row-details.tsx`)

- Added `SendEmailButton` to the case actions bar
- Positioned between Print PDF and Delete buttons
- Button automatically hides when customer email is empty

### 5. Documentation

- Created `docs/EMAIL_CONFIGURATION.md` with:

  - Environment variables setup guide
  - Example configurations for Gmail, Outlook, and custom domains
  - Troubleshooting tips
  - Security best practices
  - Production deployment guidelines

- Created `.env.local.example` template for easy setup

## Environment Variables Required

```env
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host.com        # SMTP server hostname
SMTP_PORT=587                       # SMTP port (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
SMTP_SECURE=false                   # true for SSL, false for TLS
SMTP_USER=your-email@example.com    # SMTP authentication username
SMTP_PASS=your-password             # SMTP authentication password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@example.com       # Optional: sender email address
```

## Email Content

The email includes:

- Professional HTML formatting
- Service number
- Customer name
- Current status
- Received items (if available)
- Issues reported (if available)
- Solutions provided (if available)
- PDF attachment with full warranty case details

## Features

✅ **Conditional Rendering**: Button only shows when customer email exists  
✅ **Loading States**: Disabled button with "Sending..." text during operation  
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for missing config or send failures  
✅ **PDF Reuse**: Leverages existing PDF generation logic  
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Server components for pages, client components for interactivity  
✅ **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for success/error states  
✅ **Custom SMTP**: Supports any SMTP service (Gmail, Outlook, custom domains)

## Usage

1. Set up SMTP environment variables in `.env.local`
2. Restart development server
3. Open a warranty case with a customer email

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
